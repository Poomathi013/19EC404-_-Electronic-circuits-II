2### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1=25HZ | f1"=250hz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2=170khz | f2"=450khz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl  \) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 447hz\) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 26.5db \) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 22.54\) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point |Go= 23.5 |Go"= 22.54 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
