## **Result**
Thus, the **voltage series feedback amplifier** is designed and constructed.  
The following parameters are calculated:

| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1 = 200Hz | f2 = 100 Hz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2 = 0 KHz | f2'' = 12 KHz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 78 KHz) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 12.9 KHz) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 16.70) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 14.52) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | G0 = 10  | G0'' = 7.8 |
---
**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
